# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to build this project by my desire to develop my front-end web development skills in my efforts to pursue a career within the field.

I built this project to provide a solid foundation before beginning by bootcamp and also to serve as a record of my humble beginnings in front-end development.

This Prework Study Guide contains basic information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

I learned how to make use of feature branches within a Gitflow and its advantages. I also practiced both HTML and CSS.
